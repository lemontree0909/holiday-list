There are a couple of bodies of water with ducks and turtles, and if you are willing to walk deep into the arboretum you can also find gazelles. What’s clear from the moment you enter the arboretum is that this isn’t a place for picnicking or playing ball. Although there are benches along the routes and near the ponds, the best way to explore this space is by walking the set trails that take you through huge groves of trees. The park is specially known for its oaks, with about 18 different types of oak trees being grown in one corner of the arboretum alone.",
